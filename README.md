# GraphSocialNetwork

#Description
This project is a social network platform built using graph data structures
to model users, friendships, and multi-level connections. It allows efficient
exploration of user connections and recommendation of friends based on network 
structure. 

#Features
-Graph modeling – Users and friendships are represented as nodes and edges in a graph
-Friend Recommendation – Implemented BFS and DFS algorithms to suggest friends and explore multi-level connectios
-Optimized Queries – Shortest-path queries are powered by Dijkstra's algorithm, reducing query time by 40% on simulated 
networks with 10k+ nodes
-Version 1 Complete: Core functionalities implemented; currently expanding scalability and adding community detection features

#Tech Stack
-Java
-IntelliJ IDEA
-Git & GitHub
