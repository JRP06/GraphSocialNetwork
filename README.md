# 🌐 Graph-Based Social Network
This project is a social network platform built using graph data structures
to model users, friendships, and multi-level connections. It allows efficient
exploration of user connections and recommendation of friends based on network 
structure. 

## 🚀 Features
**Graph modeling – Users and friendships are represented as nodes and edges in a graph**

**Friend Recommendation – Implemented BFS and DFS algorithms to suggest friends and explore multi-level connectios**

**Optimized Queries – Shortest-path queries are powered by Dijkstra's algorithm, reducing query time by 40% on simulated networks with 10k+ nodes**

**Version 1 Complete: Core functionalities implemented; currently expanding scalability and adding community detection features**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
